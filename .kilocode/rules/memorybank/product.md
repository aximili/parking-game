# Product Overview: Car Parking Game

## Why This Project Exists
This project is a browser-based simulation game designed to entertain users by replicating the challenges and satisfaction of real-world car parking. It serves as a fun, skill-building exercise that tests spatial awareness, precision control, and planning. The game aims to provide a relaxing yet challenging experience, appealing to casual gamers, driving enthusiasts, or anyone looking to practice parking maneuvers in a low-stakes environment without real-world consequences.

## Problems It Solves
- **Entertainment and Engagement:** Addresses boredom by offering an interactive game that combines puzzle-solving with vehicle control, similar to popular mobile parking games but implemented in vanilla web technologies for easy accessibility.
- **Skill Development:** Simulates parking scenarios to improve hand-eye coordination and foresight, which can indirectly help with real driving skills.
- **Accessibility Issues in Gaming:** Ensures playability on both desktop (keyboard) and mobile (touch) devices, solving the problem of device-specific games by using responsive design and multi-input support.
- **Educational Value:** Teaches basic physics concepts like acceleration, steering, and collision through gameplay, making learning interactive rather than lecture-based.

## How It Should Work
The game operates as a level-based progression system:
1. **Level Selection and Start:** Players choose or progress to a level (1-5), starting with the car at a predefined position and angle.
2. **Navigation Phase:** Using arrow keys (desktop) or on-screen buttons (mobile), players drive the car through obstacles (boundaries representing walls or parked cars).
3. **Parking Phase:** Maneuver the car into a designated parking spot (lenient position check, no strict angle requirement for realism). Success triggers a visual/audio feedback and state change.
4. **Exit Phase:** After parking, drive to an exit area (e.g., road) to complete the level, advancing to the next.
5. **Completion and Restart:** Levels increase in complexity (e.g., straight to parallel parking). Restart button resets the current level; all levels done shows congratulations.

Core mechanics include realistic physics (acceleration, friction, bicycle-model steering), collision detection (AABB with push-back), and procedural audio (Web Audio API for sounds). The game runs on a continuous render loop using requestAnimationFrame.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive and Responsive Controls:** Smooth input handling with gradual acceleration/deceleration for precise control; seamless switch between keyboard and touch inputs.
- **Visual Feedback:** Clear rendering with SVG assets for scalability; overlays for states (e.g., "PARKED!" screen); fallback to colored shapes if assets fail.
- **Progressive Challenge:** Start simple (straight parking) and build to complex (parallel parking with multiple obstacles) to maintain engagement without frustration.
- **Immersive Audio:** Subtle beeps for success/crash/exit to enhance feedback without overwhelming.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility:** Responsive UI adjusts for mobile; no installation neededâ€”just open in a browser.
- **Short Sessions:** Quick levels (1-2 minutes each) for casual play; level selector for replayability.
- **Error Recovery:** Collisions stop the car but allow immediate retry; no permadeath or penalties to keep it fun.

Overall, the UX prioritizes accessibility, realism, and satisfaction from successful parking, targeting a broad audience from kids learning coordination to adults reliving driving tests.
