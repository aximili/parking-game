# Project Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is developing a fully playable browser-based car parking simulation game. The game features realistic car physics, collision detection, 5 predefined levels with increasing difficulty (from straight to parallel parking), cross-device controls (keyboard for desktop, touch buttons for mobile), visual rendering with SVG assets, and procedural audio feedback. The codebase is modular, separated into distinct JS files for game logic, physics, controls, and levels, ensuring maintainability.

## Recent Changes
Implemented SAT collision detection in physics.js for accurate angled car collisions, fixed script loading order in index.html, corrected parameter passing in game.js, simplified collision response to stop car on contact to prevent unnatural warping.

## Next Steps
- Refine physics for more realism, such as adding tire grip, better collision response, or variable friction based on surface.
- Add game features like a timer, scoring system based on efficiency (e.g., time taken, collisions avoided or collisions count), or difficulty modes.
- Improve audio with more varied sounds or background music.
- Test thoroughly across devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
- Adding visual collision feedback.
