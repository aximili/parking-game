# Project Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is developing a fully playable browser-based car parking simulation game. The game features realistic car physics, collision detection, 5 predefined levels with increasing difficulty (from straight to parallel parking), cross-device controls (keyboard for desktop, touch buttons for mobile), visual rendering with SVG assets, and procedural audio feedback. The codebase is modular, separated into distinct JS files for game logic, physics, controls, and levels, ensuring maintainability.

## Recent Changes
- **Collision Detection**: Fixed collision detection system using Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) for accurate car-boundary collision detection
- **Collision Response**: Implemented proper collision response that stops the car immediately upon collision and prevents further movement into boundaries
- **Visual Feedback**: Added collision visual effects including screen shake and particle effects for better user feedback
- **Audio Feedback**: Enhanced collision sounds with cooldown to prevent sound spam during repeated collisions
- **Screen Shake Effect**: Added dynamic screen shake that scales with collision impact speed for more immersive feedback

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Physics Update**: Modified [`CarPhysics.update()`](js/physics.js:45) to return collision results and handle immediate velocity stopping
- **Game Integration**: Updated [`ParkingGame.update()`](js/game.js:56) to trigger visual and audio effects on collision
- **Visual Effects**: Added [`triggerCollisionEffect()`](js/game.js:199) and [`drawCollisionEffect()`](js/game.js:210) methods for particle effects
- **Screen Shake**: Implemented [`addScreenShake()`](js/game.js:252) and [`updateScreenShake()`](js/game.js:258) methods with intensity scaling

## Next Steps
- Test the collision fix across all levels to ensure consistent behavior
- Consider adding additional visual indicators for collision boundaries
- Monitor player feedback on collision responsiveness
- Add game features like a timer, scoring system based on efficiency (e.g., time taken, collisions avoided or collisions count), or difficulty modes
- Improve audio with more varied sounds or background music
- Test thoroughly across devices and browsers to ensure compatibility
