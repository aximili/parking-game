# Project Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is developing a fully playable browser-based car parking simulation game. The game features realistic car physics, collision detection, 5 predefined levels with increasing difficulty (from straight to parallel parking), cross-device controls (keyboard for desktop, touch buttons for mobile), visual rendering with SVG assets, and procedural audio feedback. The codebase is modular, separated into distinct JS files for game logic, physics, controls, and levels, ensuring maintainability.

## Recent Changes
This is the initial project state following basic implementation. No recent changes have been made. The core functionality is complete: the game loads, players can select levels, drive the car, park successfully, exit to complete levels, and progress through all 5 levels with appropriate state transitions and feedback.

## Next Steps
- Enhance level design by making levels data-driven (e.g., load from JSON files) for easier addition of more levels beyond 5.
- Refine physics for more realism, such as adding tire grip, better collision response, or variable friction based on surface.
- Add game features like a timer, scoring system based on efficiency (e.g., time taken, collisions avoided), or difficulty modes.
- Improve audio with more varied sounds or background music.
- Optimize performance for larger levels or smoother rendering on low-end devices.
- Test thoroughly across devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
- Consider deployment options, such as hosting on GitHub Pages for easy sharing.
