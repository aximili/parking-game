This is a browser-based car parking simulation game with a number of levels of increasing difficulty. The player controls the car using arrow keys on desktop or on-screen touch buttons on mobile to navigate through obstacles to a parking spot. Upon successful parking (with lenient position checks and audio/visual feedback), the player then drives to an exit area to complete the level and progress to the next level. The game features realistic physics (bicycle-model steering, friction, AABB collisions), Canvas-based rendering with SVG assets, and procedural Web Audio API sounds, aiming to build spatial awareness and provide entertaining, accessible gameplay across devices.
